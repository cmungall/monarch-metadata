BioGRID is an interaction repository with data compiled through comprehensive curation efforts. BioGRID currently holds over 980,000 interactions curated from both high-throughput datasets and individual focused studies, as derived from over 55,000 publications in the primary literature. Complete coverage of the entire literature is maintained for budding year (S. cerevisiae), fission yeast (S. pome), and thale cress (A. thaliana), and efforts to expand curation across multiple metazoan species are underway. All data are freely provided via the search index and available for download in standardized formats.
