The Human Phenotype Ontology has been developed to provide a structured and controlled vocabulary for the phenotypic features encountered in human hereditary and other disease. The goal is to provide resource for the computational analysis of the human phenome, with a focus on monogenic diseases listed in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and Orphanet databases, for which annotations are also provided.
